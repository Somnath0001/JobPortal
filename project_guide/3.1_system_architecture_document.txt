Here's an updated system architecture document reflecting your technology choices:
System Architecture Document
Introduction:
The Job Portal is a web-based application designed to connect job seekers with employers.
System Components:
Frontend:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Minimal JavaScript usage (for form validation and basic interactions)
Backend:
Python (Flask)
Database: MySQL (Relational Database Management System)
API Gateway: Flask-RESTful
Database:
MySQL (Relational Database Management System)
Database schema: Normalized, 3NF
Storage: Indexed, partitioned
Authentication and Authorization:
Authentication: Bcrypt password hashing
Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
API:
RESTful API (Flask-RESTful)
API endpoints: Job postings, applications, resumes, users
Data formats: JSON, XML
System Interactions:
User Registration:
User submits registration form
Backend validates input, hashes password
Database stores user data
Job Posting:
Employer creates job posting
Backend validates input, stores job data
Database updates job listings
Application Submission:
Job seeker applies to job posting
Backend validates input, stores application data
Database updates application status
Resume Management:
Job seeker uploads resume
Backend stores resume data
Database updates resume information

Scalability and Performance:
Horizontal scaling: Add more servers
Vertical scaling: Increase server resources
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms
Load balancing: Distribute traffic evenly
Security:
Authentication: Bcrypt password hashing
Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Data encryption: SSL/TLS
Secure password storage
Please let me know if you'd like me to revise anything.
Next steps:
Design database schema
Implement backend functionality using Flask
Create frontend UI using HTML and CSS
