I'll guide you through the process, but I can't create visual images or a clickable prototype directly. However, I can provide a detailed description of the wireframes and prototype.
Step 1.3: Create a Rough Wireframe and Prototype
Tool: Figma (a popular wireframing and prototyping tool)
Wireframes:
Homepage:
Header with logo, navigation menu, and search bar
Hero section with tagline, call-to-action (CTA) button, and background image
Featured jobs section with job listings and CTAs
Footer with contact information, social media links, and copyright text
Job Listings:
Job listing cards with title, description, location, and CTAs
Filtering and sorting options (e.g., location, job type, experience level)
Pagination for multiple pages of job listings
Application Form:
Header with job title and company name
Form fields for applicant information (e.g., name, email, resume upload)
Form fields for cover letter and additional information
Submit button and loading animation
Prototype:
Create a clickable prototype using Figma's prototyping features. Link the wireframes together to simulate user interactions.
Prototype Flow:
Homepage → Job Listings (click on a job listing)
Job Listings → Job Details (click on a job title)
Job Details → Application Form (click on "Apply" CTA)
Application Form → Submission Confirmation (click on "Submit" button)
Figma Prototype:
Imagine a Figma prototype with the above wireframes linked together. Clicking on elements would navigate to the corresponding pages.
Please note that this is a text-based representation. To create visual wireframes and a prototype, you'll need to use a tool like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.
If you'd like, I can provide more details on creating wireframes and prototypes in Figma or other tools.
