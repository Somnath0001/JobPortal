Step 1.4: Estimate Project Timeline and Resources
Objective: Break down the project into manageable phases and tasks, estimate the time required for each task, and identify the necessary resources.
What to do:
Break down the project:
Divide the project into phases (e.g., research, design, development, testing, deployment)
Further break down each phase into smaller tasks (e.g., research: identify features, analyze competitors, create wireframes)
Estimate time for each task:
Use your expertise and historical data to estimate the time required for each task
Consider factors like complexity, dependencies, and potential roadblocks
Identify resources:
List the libraries, frameworks, tools, and software needed for each task
Consider human resources: team members, freelancers, or external experts
Tools to use:
Project management tools: Asana, Trello, Jira, or similar tools to organize and visualize tasks
Spreadsheets: Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to estimate time and resources
Mind mapping tools: MindMeister or Coggle to create visual diagrams of tasks and dependencies
Documentation:
Create a project schedule: Outline phases, tasks, estimated time, and resources
Task list: Detail each task, including dependencies, time estimates, and assigned resources
Resource list: Document required libraries, frameworks, tools, and human resources
How to proceed:
Review and refine: Review your estimates and resource identification, refine as needed
Share with team: Communicate the project schedule and task list to team members
Track progress: Regularly update the project schedule and task list to reflect progress and changes
